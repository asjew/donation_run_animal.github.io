# About this project

The Donation Run project was created as a final group project for the Girls Who Code 2016 Summer Immersion Program located at Twitter's San Francisco HQ. This project was inspired by a goal of making donations free and fun. 

The games uses the [EaselJS library](https://createjs.com/easeljs) for the overall mechanisms for the games. We had five themes - Animal, Education, Environment, Health, and Hunger - that corresponded to each game and donation links. Once the player reached a certain amount of points, they would be able to make a free donation. Each team member was in charge of their own theme and incorporated their own Bitmoji as the avatar. The items collected correlates to the theme and was determined by the team member.

The project website that links to all games was created with Bootstrap.
